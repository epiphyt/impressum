Impressum provides you with a full-fledged easy to use imprint generator right within your WordPress site.

== Description ==

_Impressum_ adds a full-fledged and easy to use imprint generator in your WordPress dashboard. Once setup, Impressum takes care of your legal notices. Once legal requirements change, _Impressum_ will update your legal texts either on it's own or ask for your help if the changes can't be made automatically. Your imprint is generated right within WordPress, so your personal information won't be sent to a third party server.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/impressum` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
1. Use the Settings->Impressum screen to configure the plugin.
1. Add the `[impressum]` shortcode wherever you want to output your imprint.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I need an imprint on my website? =

In certain countries like Germany and Austria, the law requires some website owners to add their contact information to their sites.

= But there are online generators for that =

Yes and they are great. But adding an imprint generator directly to your WordPress install makes it pretty easy for you to stay up to date.

= How do I use _Impressum_? =

After you install and activate _Impressum_ we will kindly ask you to populate some form fields with all the data you are legally required to add to your imprint. _Impressum_ will guide you through this process.

By adding the shortcode '[impressum]' anywhere on your site, you can choose where to output your imprint.

After this initial setup, _Impressum_ just sits in your install serves your imprint. Once legal requirements change, _Impressum_ will notify you about necessary changes.

= Can I really use this plugin free of charge? =

Yes. _Impressum_ is an always will be available for free. However, if your site is legally operated by a legal entity who's not an individual person, you must install _Impressum Plus_, in order to use all fields necessary for your legal entity. _Impressum Plus_ will be available soon.
