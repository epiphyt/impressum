Yes and they are great. But adding an imprint generator directly to your WordPress install makes it pretty easy for you to stay up to date.

After you install and activate _Impressum_ we will kindly ask you to populate some form fields with all the data you are legally required to add to your imprint. _Impressum_ will guide you trough this process.
