== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I need an imprint on my website? =

In certain countries like Germany and Austria, the law requires some website owners to add their contact information to their sites.

= But there are online generators for that =

Yes, and they are great. But adding an imprint generator directly to your WordPress install makes it pretty easy for you to stay up to date.

= How do I use Impressum? =

After you install and activate Impressum we will kindly ask you to populate some form fields with all the data you are legally required to add to your imprint. Impressum will guide you through this process.

By adding the "Imprint" block anywhere on your site, you can choose where to output your imprint. Alternatively, you can use the shortcode `[impressum]`.

After this initial setup, Impressum just sits in your installation and serves your imprint. Once legal requirements change, Impressum will notify you about necessary changes.

= Can I really use this plugin free of charge? =

Yes. Impressum is and always will be available for free. However, if your site is legally operated by a legal entity who's not an individual person, you must install _Impressum Plus_, in order to use all fields necessary for your legal entity. Get it from here: [https://impressum.plus/en/](https://impressum.plus/en/).

= Does Impressum share any of my data? (GDPR) =

No. Impressum keeps all your data inside your own WordPress install. There is no data transmitted to us or a third party service. But of course the "Imprint" block or the '[impressum]' shortcode will be displayed publicly on your website.

= Is Impressum compatible with the WP block editor "Gutenberg"? =

Yes. Since version 2.0.0 there is a block "Imprint" for this exact purpose.

= Who are you folks? =

We are [Epiphyt](https://epiph.yt/en/), your friendly neighborhood WordPress plugin shop from southern Germany.

= How can I report security bugs? =

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/impressum)
